# Airbnb posting
Your team was hired by Airbnb to analyze descriptions of postings. The Airbnb management team wants to know if there are any business insights that can be found in the postings’ content (text content and numerical content)
Working in teams, you will explore the data to create visualizations. Each Team is also expected to create visualizations using Tableau and perform text analysis using R-programming.
Each student will need to deploy a free MongoDB cluster. After deploying the cluster, student will be able to load “sample data” that includes the AirBnb collection of documents.
